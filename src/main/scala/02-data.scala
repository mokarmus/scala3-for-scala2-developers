/**
 * ENUMS
 * 
 * Scala 3 adds support for "enums", which are to sealed traits like case classes 
 * were to classes. That is, enums cut down on the boilerplate required to use 
 * the "sealed trait" pattern for modeling so-called sum types, in a fashion very 
 * similar to how case classes cut down on the boilerplate required to use 
 * classes to model so-called product types.
 * 
 * Strictly speaking, Scala 3 enums are not the same as Java enums: while the 
 * constructors of enums are finite, and defined statically at compile-time in the 
 * same file, these constructors may have parameters, and therefore, the total 
 * number of values of any enum type could be large or infinite.
 * 
 * Enums and case classes provide first-class support for "algebraic data types" 
 * in Scala 3.
